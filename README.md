Space was always my passion and I love observing stars, galaxies, solar system with binocular.

The [NASA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/) community is for anything related to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the latest news, events, current and future missions, and more.
It has 1.3m Members with 282 IN SPACE and it was created on Jul 17, 2008.

The [Space Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/) is a community for sharing & discussing informative content on: * Astrophysics * Cosmology * Space Exploration * Planetary Science * Astrobiology. It has 17.2m
Members, 5.0k Online and it was created Jan 26, 2008.

The goal is to develope a binary class classification which would be able to recongnize the Nasa community from Space Discussion. These two were chose similar to test the classification methods power.
